# LLM-Powered Fraud Detection & Anomaly Analysis

## Overview
This project is a high-performance fraud detection system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformer models to analyze transaction descriptions, detect anomalies, and flag potential fraudulent activities. The solution integrates with a distributed vector database for efficient similarity search and real-time anomaly identification.

## Architecture
The process is divided into 8 phases:
1. **Data Preparation & Multi-Modal Feature Engineering:** Simulate transaction data and generate embeddings.
2. **Hybrid Embedding Generation & Multi-LLM Integration:** Generate and store high-dimensional embeddings.
3. **Distributed Vector Search & Real-Time Detection:** Implement high-speed similarity search.
4. **Full Pipeline Development & Rule-Based Anomaly Detection:** Build an end-to-end pipeline with Kafka, ETL, and alerts.
5. **Real-Time Monitoring & High-Performance Alert System:** Implement dashboards and alerts.
6. **Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance:** Ensure encryption, authentication, and regulatory compliance.
7. **Frontend Dashboard & API Development:** Build a web interface and APIs using Streamlit and FastAPI.
8. **Testing, Deployment & CI/CD Automation:** Implement testing, deploy with Kubernetes, and set up CI/CD.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
